			<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 cl-sm">
				<div class="item">
					<p class="title" id="t1">Run</p>
					<p class="content">In a dangerous situation, running should always be your first choice and priority.  Look for exit signs and, if necessary, improvised exits such as windows.  Your first priority should be to reach safety and to contact the authorities.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 cl-sm">
				<div class="item" >
					<p class="title" id="t2">Hide</p>
					<p class="content">If running is not an option, your next choice is to find a good hiding spot.  Look for areas that are out of the way and, if possible, are defensible.  Look for closets that can be locked and make sure to turn of the lights.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 cl-sm">
				<div class="item" id="secondRow">
					<p class="title" id="t3">Fight</p>
					<p class="content">When running and hiding are not an option your final choice is to fight.  However, if you must fight your goal should still be to run or hide.  Fighting should be merely a means to running or fighting.</p>
